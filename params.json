{"name":"Welcome","tagline":"Zesterer's GitHub Projects","body":"## Welcome To My Personal GitHub Page\r\n\r\nMy name is Barry Smith (Zesterer is my online alias). I am a software developer that usually works in C++, Python, Vala or D. My projects cover a relatively big array of subjects. I've built games, simulators, libraries, physics engines, raytracers, text editors, emulators, chess AI and web browsers. Feel free to take a look through my work if you want. I usually license my work under GPL2, so it's totally fine for you to modify, copy and use most of my work freely. Although, of course, I'd prefer you gave me credit for it when you do.\r\n\r\nIf you want to contact me, feel free to do so via my email address: [barry.of.smith@gmail.com](mailto:barry.of.smith@gmail.com). I'll try to answer you when I can, but if you can't contact me then you can do so via Skype (zesterer) or Tox (450F5D2C82D64B3A651650D8D03D26E962378AE8DB17B726303558D7A726783461D30907491F).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Popular / Significant Projects\r\n\r\n### Vast\r\n\r\nAs The Name Suggests: A Pretty Large Space Sim. Makes use of voxel-body ships for realtime deformation.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/vast\r\n\r\n### Nilts\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/nilts\r\n\r\nA 3D procedurally generated open-world RPG-type game. I'm not really sure what it's about yet. Still in heavy development.\r\n\r\n![An old(ish) screenshot of Nilts](https://github.com/zesterer/nilts/misc/screen.png)\r\n\r\n### Opplyse\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/opplyse\r\n\r\nA clean, efficient GTK3 text editor for programmers. The big brother of Vulcan.\r\n\r\n### Vulcan\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/vulcan\r\n\r\nA minimalistic text editor designed for both ordinary use and software development.. Replaced by Opplyse.\r\n\r\n![A screenshot showing some of the features of Vulcan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zesterer/vulcan/master/misc/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n### LibVolume\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/libvolume\r\n\r\nA voxel and 3D rendering library. Used in other projects such as Vast and Nilts.\r\n\r\n### Emul8or\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/emul8or\r\n\r\nA Chip-8 emulator. It's capable of playing most Chip-8 games fairly well.\r\n\r\n![Emul8or running classic Pong](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zesterer/emul8or/master/doc/pong-chip8.png)\r\n\r\n### SDF Test\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/sdf-test\r\n\r\nAn SDF-based raytracer built in C++ using SDL as a windowing library. it generated quite pretty images.\r\n\r\n![An image generated by SDF Test](https://github.com/zesterer/sdf-test/misc/screen.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
