{"name":"Welcome","tagline":"Zesterer's GitHub Projects","body":"## Assorted Nonsense And Inconsequential Experiments\r\n\r\nGreetings, citizen of the internet. Welcome to my GitHub page.\r\n\r\nMy name is Joshua Barretto (also known as 'zesterer' or 'Barry Smith'). I'm a software developer usually working in C++, C, Vala, Python, C# or D. My projects cover a relatively large variety of topics. I've built simulators, libraries, games, physics engines, raytracers, neural network learning systems, text editors, emulators, chess AI and web browsers. Feel free to take a look through my work if you at all have the inclination or level of boredom required to do so. I tend to license my work under GPL2, so it's totally fine for you to modify, copy and use most of my work in any manner dictated by GPL2 (or the license attributed to the project in question) although, of course, I'd be happy if you could give me credit when you do.\r\n\r\nIf you want to contact me, feel free to do so via my email address: [barry.of.smith@gmail.com](mailto:barry.of.smith@gmail.com). I'll try to answer you when I can, but failing that then you can do so via Skype [zesterer](skype:zesterer).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Popular / Significant Projects\r\n\r\n### Vast\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/vast\r\n\r\nAs The Name Suggests: A Pretty Large Space Sim. Makes use of voxel-body ships for realtime deformation.\r\n\r\n![Taking a look at an asteroid with the ship lights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zesterer/voxeltest/master/misc/screen0.png)\r\n\r\n![Down on the surface of a planet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zesterer/voxeltest/master/misc/screen1.png)\r\n\r\n### Nilts\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/nilts\r\n\r\nA 3D procedurally generated open-world RPG-type game. I'm not really sure what it's about yet. Still in heavy development.\r\n\r\n![An old(ish) screenshot of Nilts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zesterer/nilts/master/misc/screen.png)\r\n\r\n### Opplyse\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/opplyse\r\n\r\nA clean, efficient GTK3 text editor for programmers. The big brother of Vulcan.\r\n\r\n### Vulcan\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/vulcan\r\n\r\nA minimalistic text editor designed for both ordinary use and software development.. Replaced by Opplyse.\r\n\r\n![A screenshot showing some of the features of Vulcan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zesterer/vulcan/master/misc/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n### LibVolume\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/libvolume\r\n\r\nA voxel and 3D rendering library. Used in other projects such as Vast and Nilts.\r\n\r\n### Emul8or\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/emul8or\r\n\r\nA Chip-8 emulator. It's capable of playing most Chip-8 games fairly well.\r\n\r\n![Emul8or running classic Pong](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zesterer/emul8or/master/doc/pong-chip8.png)\r\n\r\n### SDF Test\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zesterer/sdf-test\r\n\r\nAn SDF-based raytracer built in C++ using SDL as a windowing library. it generated quite pretty images.\r\n\r\n![An image generated by SDF Test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zesterer/sdf-test/master/misc/screen.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
