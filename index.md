## Assorted Nonsense And Inconsequential Experiments

Greetings, citizen of the internet. Welcome to my GitHub page.

My name is Joshua Barretto (also known as 'zesterer' or 'Barry Smith'). I'm a software developer usually working in C++, C, Vala, Python, C# or D. My projects cover a relatively large variety of topics. I've built simulators, libraries, games, physics engines, raytracers, neural network learning systems, text editors, emulators, chess AI and web browsers. Feel free to take a look through my work if you at all have the inclination or level of boredom required to do so. I tend to license my work under GPL2, so it's totally fine for you to modify, copy and use most of my work in any manner dictated by GPL2 (or the license attributed to the project in question) although, of course, I'd be happy if you could give me credit when you do.

If you want to contact me, feel free to do so via my email address: [barry.of.smith@gmail.com](mailto:barry.of.smith@gmail.com). I'll try to answer you when I can, but failing that then you can do so via Skype [zesterer](skype:zesterer).
